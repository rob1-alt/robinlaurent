            During this internship, I had three main missions that I had to accomplish.

First of all, I was in charge of the company’s phone, that means that when somebody phoned the company, I was the one that was answering the phone. 

At Teach’r, teachers, before they are able to give lessons, are undergoing a profile verification directly following their inscription on the platform. It happened on messenger, and potential teachers are responding to questions on Messenger, and the answers are either written, or spoken answers. The questions are under the form of a conversation between the future teacher, and a chatbot that represents someone from the company. My job on this situation was to read the whole conversation, listen to the vocal answers, and decide whether or not the teacher is able to give courses via the platform.
To do that, my own Facebook account was linked to the company’s Facebook account. Every morning, it was my first thing to do, to check if new potential teachers had created their account during the night. 
During my internship, I accepted around 60 news teachers to the platform.

Another important mission that I was assigned to was the customer follow-up. 
To see all the courses that are created, done, and that are pending, they are using a database, that includes for each course, the name of the subject, the date of the creation of the demand, and the date when the course will take place, the length of the course, the name of the student, its scholar level, whether or not the course is a remote one, and if it's not, the address where it will take place, and most important, how many teachers applied to give this course.

Once one or more teachers agreed to give a certain course, the person that asked for this course must choose a teacher and confirm it, so that the course will really take place.
But it happens that some parents are not confirming any teachers for a course. That’s where I intervene. 

        </p>

<p>My job here was to call parents that did not confirm any teachers for their course. Most of the time, they did not confirm any teachers because they were no longer interested in this course, maybe because they found it somewhere else. 


In a normal call, the process was the following : first, I presented myself, that I come from the Teach’r company, then I reminded the parent that they formulated a demand for a course in such or such subject for their child, after that I was telling them that this many teachers responded their demand, and finally asking them if they were still interested in this course demand. For this task, it is really important to be talkative, and have a sense of communication, and to be smiling, and that this smile could be felt through the phone, that the other person could hear it.
It also requires patience, because it happens that sometimes the people I was calling didn’t want to talk to me, and were very unpleasant with me. 
Sometimes, this mission was a bit different, because it happened that some courses were left unresponded by any teacher, that no teachers are interested in giving this course at the moment. 
The process was quite the same, however if they are still interested in having this course, it means that I would have to search for a suitable teacher.

Finding teachers for unresponded courses was one of my other missions.
To do that, I would have to look into the database, a database where all teachers of the platform are listed. On this database, there is information listed on teachers, such as their names, their phone number and email address, the subjects they can teach, where they live, if they are registered as self-entrepreneurs, and the date when they last agreed to give a course on the platform.

To look for a teacher, I had to take into account several datas : whether or not the course is a remote one, and the address where it has to take place.
Knowing that, I traced a twenty kilometers ray around the address where the course had to take place. In the area now traced, I looked for a teacher in this area that could teach the subject of the course required in the teacher database we had. I was selecting the most recently active teacher, so that I would maximize my chances of finding a teacher.
        </p>
<p>
Whenever I found a teacher that could do the job, I contacted this teacher by phone, and asked if giving this course would interest him or her. 
But it also happened that I did not find any teacher, because maybe nobody was interested, or because it was a too complex subject, in the way that there are not many teachers available on the database, because maybe it was a Chinese course, or an accounting course. 


In this case, I had to search for a teacher on other platforms, such as Leboncoin, a classified ads website that gathers lots of teachers that are offering their help on a subject. 
In this case I would do the same method, finding a teacher in a twenty kilometers area. I would send messages to teachers that could suit for this course

I would indicate to them the name of the application, tell them to create an account, and to answer to the course requirement as soon as possible.
Doing that is doubly beneficial for the company, because it creates new teachers accounts on the application, that will allow courses to be answered more rapidly, and it will also reduce the waiting time for parents before their courses are accepted by a teacher.

</p> <p>These two missions were the main things I had to do on a daily basis. However, sometimes I had some one-time missions during the internship.

When my two-months internship would end, nobody in the company could deal with the missions I had to do on a full-time period. Because of that, the company needed to look for a person that would replace me at the end of my contract.

The recruitment process was composed of an advertisement posted on several recruitment platforms, such as Indeed. The candidates would undergo a first phone interview, then the selected ones would undergo a face to face interview, and we would select the candidate.
I took a great part in this recruitment process, as I did all the phone interviews. </p>


<p>The recruitment process lasted 2 weeks, the first week being the phone interview period, and the second week being the face to face interviews phase.
To do so, I had to gather several information on the candidates, such as their age, if they had any experience, how autonomous they feel, their study domain, and asking them to describe the company, to understand how well they understood the concept of the company.
During this first phase, I conducted around 15 phone interviews, and kept 4 candidates for the second phase of the interview, because their experiences were interesting and potentially valuable, and because I could hear through the phone that they were smiling, that they had a cheerful voice.


For the second interview phase, I accompanied the president on the face to face interview. He was the one asking most of the questions, but I was asking some too. The face to face interview was composed of typical questions, but also a role play, in which the candidate would be put in the place of a Business Developer that calls a parent in order to confirm a teacher for the course he asked, to see how the candidate would handle a conversation. The candidate knew the topics of the role play one day before the interview. However, we wanted to destabilize the candidate by asking unexpected questions, to see how the candidate 
would react when facing situations where they are not in control, that happens a lot when you phone people.
At the end of each interview, the president and I debriefed on what we thought about the different candidates, and at the end of the recruitment week, we decided which candidate would be able to join the company.
My final mission for the company was to form the intern that we recruited. To do so, I showed him the working of all the tools, the websites that he’ll be using. I taught him the tips I gathered during my internship. Also, I tried to put him in as many different situations that I’ve encountered as possible, to ease him of the task.
