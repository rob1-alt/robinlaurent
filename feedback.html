        <p>On this page you must present your role during your internship, your various missions and the skills that you acquired. Each skill must be illustrated precisely using the CAR (Context / Actions / Result) method. 

            During this internship, I had three main missions that I had to accomplish.
            
            In Teach’r, teachers, before they are able to give lessons, are undergoing a profile verification directly following their inscription on the platform. It happened on messenger, and potential teachers are responding to questions on Messenger, and the answers are either written, or spoken answers. The questions are under the form of a conversation between the future teacher, and a chatbot that represents someone from the company. My job on this situation was to read the whole conversation, listen to the vocal answers, and decide whether or not the teacher is able to give courses via the platform.
            To do that, my own Facebook account was linked to the company’s Facebook account. Every morning, it was my first thing to do, to check if new potential teachers had created their account during the night. 
            During my internship, I accepted around 60 news teachers to the platform.
            
            Another important mission that I was assigned to was the customer follow-up. 
            To see all the courses that are created, done, and that are pending, they are using a database, that includes for each course, the name of the subject, the date of the creation of the demand, and the date when the course will take place, the length of the course, the name of the student, its scholar level, whether or not the course is a remote one, and if it's not, the address where it will take place, and most important, how many teachers applied to give this course.
            Once one or more teachers agreed to give a certain course, the person that asked for this course must choose a teacher and confirm it, so that the course will really take place.
            But it happens that some parents are not confirming any teachers for a course. That’s where I intervene. 
            My job here was to call parents that did not confirm any teachers for their course. Most of the time, they did not confirm any teachers because they were no longer interested in this course, maybe because they found it somewhere else. 
            In a normal call, the process was the following : first, I presented myself, that I come from the Teach’r company, then I reminded the parent that they formulated a demand for a course in such or such subject for their child, after that I was telling them that this many teachers responded their demand, and finally asking them if they were still interested in this course demand. For this task, it is really important to be talkative, and have a sense of communication, and to be smiling, and that this smile could be felt through the phone, that the other person could hear it.
            It also requires patience, because it happens that sometimes the people I was calling didn’t want to talk to me, and were very unpleasant with me. 
            Sometimes, this mission was a bit different, because it happened that some courses were left unresponded by any teacher, that no teachers are interested in giving this course at the moment. 
            The process was quite the same, however if they are still interested in having this course, it means that I would have to search for a suitable teacher.
            
            Finding teachers for unresponded courses was one of my other missions.
            To do that, I would have to look into the database, a database where all teachers of the platform are listed. On this database, there is information listed on teachers, such as their names, their phone number and email address, the subjects they can teach, where they live, if they are registered as self-entrepreneurs, and the date when they last agreed to give a course on the platform.
            To look for a teacher, I had to take into account several datas : whether or not the course is a remote one, and the address where it has to take place.
            Knowing that, I traced a twenty kilometers ray around the address where the course had to take place. In the area now traced, I looked for a teacher in this area that could teach the subject of the course required in the teacher database we had. I was selecting the most recently active teacher, so that I would maximize my chances of finding a teacher.
            Whenever I found a teacher that could do the job, I contacted this teacher by phone, and asked if giving this course would interest him or her.
