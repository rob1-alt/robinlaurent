        <p>Before starting this internship in a startup, I had preconceptions about working in a start-up working atmosphere.
            I had in mind that it would be a very decontracted workplace, filled with people that are enjoying their jobs and that are happy to be coming to work.
            For me the idea of hierarchy in a start-up was different from a more regular company, in the sense that everybody helps and reports to everybody, and I thought that I would be working with young people.<br>
            
            And in reality, all of my thoughts came out to be true, except maybe for the workplace, we were located under the roof of a school in Paris, in a very small room, that could suit arounds 8 people, and that wasn’t exactly matching the idea I had of a start-up. But then I realized that this start-up was still young, and was in the incubator of the school it was in.<br>
            
            Apart from that, all that I thought was true, the hierarchy wasn’t really felt as a relation of “dominance” between an employee and an employer, but more as a co-worker.
             Everybody worked together, the working atmosphere was really appropriate for efficient work. For example, we always took our lunches together, and played little games just after lunch, in order to reinforce our bounds.
