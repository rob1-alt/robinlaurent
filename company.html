            <p>On this page you must present the company: its activity, sector of activity, history, organisation, practices…

                Teach’r is a company that could be classified as a start-up. It was created in 2019 by three friends, Eytan, who is the president, Eliott, who is the CEO, and Alexis, who is the CMO
                This company is a third sector company that could place itself in the educational sector. The company owns a mobile application whose role is to connect parents and teachers so that students in need could benefit from private lessons in many domains, for every scholar level. 
                
                
                The members that are composing this company are the Co-founder and CEO of the company, two work-study students, one in charge of the development of the application and the coding of the application and the updates. He responds directly to the CEO, who initiated the development of the application in the first place.
                The other work-study student is in charge of the designing part of the company, and is in charge of the creation of the advertising campaigns. 
                Other than that, there is an intern that could be considered as a community manager. This intern is in charge of the social media accounts of the company, that are the Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn and mainly the TikTok accounts. This intern is applying and posting the creations of the work-study student. 
                There is another intern, which was the job I was occupying, which is in charge of the whole customer service and customer relation part.
