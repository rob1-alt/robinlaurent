            A short summary in a few lines about your internship with the dates and length of your internship, the name of the company and of your workplace tutor. 

    The start-up internship I’ve realized took place in a company called Teach’r, located in Paris. It lasted from the 19th of April to the 10th of June, or a 8 weeks duration. Inside the company, I was supervised by Eytan Azria, the president of the company, and for this company, I was Business Developer
